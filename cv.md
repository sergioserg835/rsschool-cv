###About me
My goal is to become a high-level web developer. At the moment, I have focused on studying **js**, as I understand how much I need it in my work.
**Education:** economist-cybernetics (2004), management of educational institutions and their structural divisions (2011).

I worked as a teacher at the university and part-time as a computer science teacher at school. For 5 years I was the deputy director at the Zaporizhia classical lyceum.

For several years I administered the site of the Zaporizhia classical lyceum. My responsibilities included filling the site with content, adding new functionality, and periodic design edits.

I have experience in freelancing where I have done the following work:

- creating themes for WordPress;
- development of online calculators;
- development of task generators for a children's development site https://childdevelop.com.ua
- making various edits to working sites.
